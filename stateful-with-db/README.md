## Requirements

 * Maven
 * JDK
 
## Getting Started
This package contains a script (demo-start.sh) that automatically builds and deploys GigaSpaces with both a Mirror and a Space. The Space is configured to initially load data from the configured data source, so you can explore the functionality of the GigaSpaces product and build applications on top of it.
  

### Running demo-start.sh
This script does the following:

1. Builds the project.
2. Starts the service grid.
3. Deploys the Processing Units (space and mirror).
